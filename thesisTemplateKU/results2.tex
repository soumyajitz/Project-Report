\section{Results of the Second Redesign}
\label{sec:results2}

Synthesis of the second redesign of the scheduler module targeting a Xilinx
\cite{xilinx} Virtex-II Pro 30 yields the following FPGA resource statistics:
1,034 out of 13,696 slices, 522 out of 27,392 slice flip-flops, 1,900 out of
27,392 4-input LUTs, and 2 out of 136 BRAMs.  The module has a maximum
operating frequency of 143.8 MHz, which easily meets our goal of a 100 MHz
clock frequency.
