\section{Results of the Deep Approach}
\label{sec:results2}

Results of the Deep Learning Model have already been tested in Handwriting  and Digit Recognition purposes. It has given an accuracy of 99.2 p.c. on the MNIST Dataset which is a state of the art dataset for Digit Recognition and 75 p.c. accuracy on the chars74k dataset provided by Microsoft Research which is a also a state of the art dataset for character recognition purposes.
