A lot of work has been happening in the ear biometrics over the past decade. The approaches are varied with some working on Intensity-based features while others on 2-D ad 3-D curves etc. Chang et al.[2003] whole worked on the UND database and got an accuracy of 72.7p.c. using the PCA approach. A new concept called Force-Field was being brought by Hurley et al. which gave an accuracy of 99.2 p.c. on the XM2VTS dataset. Many other approaches like 3D Features, Gabor Filters, SIFT, Wavelet Transformation have been applied on different databases and results have been obtained. This project is mostly on the analysis of Biometric Humar Ear datasets on two methods - SIFT and SURF and a comparison is given on the rotation and scaling factors and how the number of features varies on such conditions keeping the real life scenarios in mind where Ear images are not obtained as compared to a dataset.
