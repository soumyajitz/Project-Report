\section{Results of the First Redesign}
making a scheduling decision is hidden because it occurs during a context
switch.  However, if a scheduling event occurs very soon after a thread is
initially context switched to, the system may have to wait for the scheduler to
finish calculating the next scheduling decision resulting from the context
switch.  This is more likely to happen with more threads in the ready-to-run
queue, due to increased execution-times of scheduling operations due to the
O(n) nature of the queue itself.  Although the amount of jitter is in the
microsecond range, it can still be further reduced by restructuring the
ready-to-run queue so that its functions are able to operate in constant
amounts of time.
