\chapter{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc} In this paper we have presented the
scheduling operations that execute in under 50 clock cycles (500 ns) or less at
the base hardware level.  From the system level, the hardware scheduler module
provides very fast scheduling operations with an end-to-end scheduling delay of
1.9 ${\mu}$s with 1.4 ${\mu}$s of jitter with 250 active threads running on a
Xilinx \cite{xilinx} Virtex-II Pro FPGA.  The integrated system level tests
have shown that the migration of scheduling services into the fabric of the
FPGA have drastically reduced the amount of system overhead and jitter related

HybridThreads project \cite{Zhou:OSframe}, which furthers the future impacts of
the project even more.  More detailed descriptions of the hybrid threads
project can be found in \cite{wiki}.
