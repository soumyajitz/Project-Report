\chapter{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc} In this paper, we have studied two scale and rotation invariant feature detecters and their application to ear recognition. Although both the SIFT and the SURF are invariant under scale and rotation changes, their performance decreases under certain conditions. The SIFT detector is more stable than the SURF detector under rotation changes. It is also found that the SIFT algorithm performs better for image decreasing, in contrast, the SURF algorithm performs better for image increasing. Experimental evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in ear recognition. In future study, we will further investigate how to increase the performance and reliability of the proposed approach.
