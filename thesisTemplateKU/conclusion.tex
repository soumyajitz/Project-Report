\chapter{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc} In this project we have studied two scale and rotation invariant feature detecters and their application to ear recognition. Although both the SIFT and the SURF are invariant under scale and rotation changes, their performance decreases under certain conditions. The SIFT detector is more stable than the SURF detector under rotation changes. It is also found that the SIFT algorithm performs better for image decreasing, in contrast, the SURF algorithm performs better for image increasing. Experimental evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in ear recognition. Next ,the deep learning approach has been applied to automatically extract the features from the dataset rather than hand-crafting them via SIFT or SURF. A comparision between both the approaches have been given where hand-crafted feature extractors give better performances with less training data while deep learning algorithms perform better with more training data. For future work, an ear dataset consisting of thousands to millions of images must be created and preprocessed for better performances. Work must be done to deep learning algorithms, which must be able to extract features from less training data and as a matter of fact it would make it easier to train on CPUs and also give better performances.

Deep Learning models can be used for various purposes and thus the models must be applied to other biometric datasets to compare their performances. As of now, deep learning has mostly been applied to face recognition algorithms and has received tremendous success, thus work must be done on other sets of biometrics like iris, fingerprint, palm and others for better performances.
