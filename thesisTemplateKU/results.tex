The modules from each of the scheduler redesigns have undergone a series of
tests in both simulated and synthesized forms.  These tests help show the
performance differences between the different ready-to-run queue structures in
terms of scheduling overhead and jitter as well as the effects of the
hybridization of the scheduler on the entire HybridThreads operating system.
