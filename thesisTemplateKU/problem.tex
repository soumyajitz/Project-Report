\section{Types of Biometrics} Biometrics has been an active field of research over the last decade. The reason behind their success is that biometric characteristics are universal, unique and permanent. Unlike other forms of authentication such as passwords or identification cards which can be stolen or faked easily.\\

There are many kinds of biometrics which can be used for authentication purposes. Among them the prominent being, Face, Ear, Palm, Fingerprint, Iris and others which are frequently being used these days in day to day life to authenticate an individual. Another reason biometrics have been used these days are due to terrorist activities and other fraudulent ways in which people impersonate themselves which are harder to catch. These days biometrics are used everywhere from Airports to ATMs to secured entry to corporate offices where checking the identity of an identity of an individual is mandatory before access is given. It helps to strengthen the security of an organization or country potential threat. As mentioned above, the different types of biometrics, different biometrics have different purposes and importance. The most popular being face recognition which is being used everywhere to authenticate people, the only disadvantage being the change in facial expression and with age the face changes upto a certain extent which makes it difficult to recognize and authenticate. Fingerprint is also being used in almost any high priority zone nowadays to authenticate and is very successful but it requires complete co-operation of an individual in order to authenticate them. The same problem happens with iris authentication where it becomes very difficult to extract the iris image to match and authenticate. 

Ear authentication comes to the rescue in such a situation due to many reasons. The primary being the stability in the human ear structure and ear images can easily be captured without the co-operation of an individual. Each ear is unique, so any side image of an individual is enough in order to authenticate a person.
