\section{Types of Biometrics} Hybrid CPU/FPGA systems form a
union between two different areas of expertise: hardware design and software

\section{Purpose of Biometric Recognition} FPGAs provide a "blank"
slate of computational components.  Standard interfaces and services have not

\section{Contributions of this Project} The main goal of this work is to develop
IP cores capable of providing run-time scheduling services to all threads, both
