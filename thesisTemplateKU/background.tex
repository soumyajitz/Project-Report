\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:back}
Most real-time
operating systems, such as RTLinux \cite{yodaiken99rtlinux}, attempt to
minimize the jitter introduced by asynchronous requests by pre-processing
external requests within a small, fast interrupt service routine that
determines if the request should be immediately handled, or can simply be
marked as pending for future service.  While this approach does reduce
jitter, it is still based on the semantics of allowing asynchronous
invocations to interrupt the CPU, and incurring the overhead of a context
switch to an interrupt service routine.
