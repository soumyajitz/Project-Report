\section{Results of the Third Redesign}
\label{sec:results3}

Synthesis of the third redesign of the scheduler module targeting a Xilinx
\cite{xilinx} Virtex-II Pro 30 yields the following FPGA resource statistics:
1,455 out of 13,696 slices, 973 out of 27,392 slice flip-flops, 2,425 out of
27,392 4-input LUTs, and 3 out of 136 BRAMs.  The module has a maximum
operating frequency of 119.6 MHz, which easily meets our goal of a 100 MHz
clock frequency.
